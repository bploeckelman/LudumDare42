Recruit an army, spread across the land to claim territory, battle your rival kingdom, and claim their castle before you **run of space**

:small_blue_diamond: Turn-based strategy
:small_blue_diamond: Hyper-realistic AI using blockchain
:small_blue_diamond: Four different unit types to recruit
- Peasant (weak, but can always be recruited, claim more territory to recruit more of them)
- Soldier (good attack and defense, required terrain: mountains :mount_fuji:)
- Archer (great defense but poor attack, required terrain: forests :deciduous_tree:)
- Wizard (great offense but poor defense, required terrain: crystals :gem:)

The game flow proceeds in rounds...
- Recruit
- Move / Attack
- Shrinking territory
